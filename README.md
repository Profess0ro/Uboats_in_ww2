# Business Requirements

### **Operational efficiency** 

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the operational efficiency of each U-boat during it´s active service time in the water. Efficiency will be measured by analyzing the total tonnage sunk and the number of vessels sunk (both merchant and warships). This analysis aims to provide researchers and other interested parties with a clearer understanding of how successful different U-boat classes were in their operations, with a focus on merchant and warship sinkings.<br>

**Requirements:**
- Collect data on all U-boats operational service, including the number of vessels sunk and total tonnage.
- Analyze and compare the efficiency of each U-boat class.
- Present the results through statistics and visualizations showing efficiency over time and across different operations.
- Provide the ability to compare performance across different U-boat classes and operation types.<br>

### **Timebased analysis of losses**

The goal of this analysis is to develop a timeline that displays the number of U-boats lost or missing over time. 

**Requirements:**

- Collect data on U-boat losses (sunk or missing) over time, categorized by date, location, and type of engagement.
- Develop a timeline visualization that shows the trend of U-boat losses over the course of the war.
<hr>

### **Analysis of National Submarine Performance Trends**

The goal of this analysis is to identify trends among submarines from different nations in order to understand which countries experienced higher or lower loss rates. Analyse which country was most effective with its submarine operations.

**Requirements:**
<br>Data Collection:<br>
Gather data on submarines from all nations, including:
- Number of submarines deployed.
- Number of vessel sunk per nation.
- Number of submarines lost or damaged.

**Perform a comparative analysis to calculate:**<br>
**Loss rate:** The ratio of submarines lost or damaged to the total number of submarines commissioned for each nation.<br>
**Success rate:** The ratio of vessels sunk to the total number of submarines deployed for each nation.

#### Extra (if there´s time)

### Identify Where Most Submarines Were Sunk

**Requirement:**<br>
Analyze data to determine the geographical areas where the majority of submarines were sunk during World War II. This analysis should include identifying and visualizing the exact locations where submarines were sunk and clustering these locations to highlight the highest-risk zones.

**Identify Locations:** <br>
Gather information on the exact coordinates (latitude and longitude) of where submarines were sunk.<br>
**Cluster Analysis:** 
<br>Perform a clustering analysis to group nearby sinking sites and identify high-intensity zones.<br>
**Risk Zones:**<br> 
Visualize these high-intensity zones on a map to clearly display where the greatest risks for submarines were located.<br>
**Trend Analysis:**<br> 
Analyze if any trends can be identified over time, showing shifts in submarine sinking patterns or risks based on different phases of the war.

### Target Audience:
All these will be used by researchers, historians, and others interested in naval history and warfare to understand the effectiveness of U-boats during their operations in WW2.
