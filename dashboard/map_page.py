        On this map, you can explore the fates and locations of WWII German U-boats. <br>
        The coordinates represent the exact positions of most of the fates, with approximately 95% of the data derived from precise longitude and latitude values. <br>
        However, some entries are less specific, such as general areas like 'the English Channel.' <br><br>
        This data has been carefully compiled from the reputable source, <a href="https://uboat.net/boats/listing.html" target="_blank">U-boat.net</a>
        , for an accurate historical overview. <br><br>
        Use the multiselect menu to filter U-boats by their fate. You can choose one or multiple fates to see the corresponding markers on the map.<br>
        The fates of the U-boats are explained below the map for your reference.
